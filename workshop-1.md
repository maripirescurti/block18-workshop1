# WORKSHOP I
Goal: Write test specifications for a series of prompts

## Prompts:

For each prompt below:
- Read the prompt.
- Identify the expectations.
- Write specifications in pseudocode/plain English for all the tests that would be useful for that prompt.
  - Try to take any "edge cases", or unexpected circumstances, into account, and write test specs for them.
  - Try not to write extraneous tests!

  ## Unit Tests:

  1. A function called "multiplication" that returns the product of the two input number.

    Tests:
    - Expect [multiplication(3, 5)] to be a number
    - Expect [multiplication(3, 5)] to be equal to 15
    - Expect [multiplication(-3, -5)] to be a positive number
    - Expect [multiplication(-3, -5)] to be equal to 15
    - Expect [multiplication(-3, 5)] to be a negative number
    - Expect [multiplication(-3, 5)] to be equal to -15
    - Expect [multiplication('a', 3)] to be an error
    - Expect [multiplication('a', 'b')] to be an error
    - Expect [multiplication(0, 5)] to be equal to
    - Expect [multiplication(3.5, 5.5)] to be equal to 19.25

  2. A function called "contactOdds" takes two arrays of integers as arguments. It should return a single array that only contains the odd numbers, in ascending order, from both the arrays.
